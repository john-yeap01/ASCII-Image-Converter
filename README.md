# ASCII-Image-Converter
Bare bones application with Tkinter for UI, and Pyinstaller to create executable. When run, users can select their images and convert them to ascii images. Uses that traditional dark green for 'hacker guy terminal code' font.



You can also use pyinstaller to make an executable app.
